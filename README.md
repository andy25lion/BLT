# Assembly instructions for the 3D printed bolt revolver

## Introduction
- This document provides detailed assembly instructions for the fully 3D printed revolver with working double-action mechanics. Follow the steps carefully to ensure a successful assembly.
- All parts are 3D printable, no additional hardware or tools required, however there are some optional recommendations below.

## Printing and Slicing Recommendations
- Decorative parts like the covers and the grip can be printed in either PETG or PLA.
- Mechanical parts like the springs, hammer, trigger etc. should be printed in PETG for best results.
- All parts can be safely printed in PETG.
- For the best print orientation refer to the oriented parts 3mf file.
- It's highly recommended to use supports where needed with the provided orientation.
- The largest part is 20 cm long, all other parts should fit in most printers.

## Tools Required
- 3D printer and slicing software
- Optional tools for preparing the printed parts: sandpaper, flush cutters, pliers
- Some parts can be glued together for a more permanent fit without affecting the functionality, these parts are indicated in the instructions below.
- Optional recommendations:
  - Lubricant (silicone, PTFE, etc.) - makes the revolver action run smoother
  - Glue - some parts can be glued together for a more permanent fit without affecting the functionality, these parts are indicated in the instructions below.
